Project Name: Blind-zones Detection using Wide-angle Camera and Distortion Correction of Images for Automotive Applications

Abstractâ€”Automobile companies have recently become quite concerned about object detection in blind zones. Accidents are often increased by objects in blind zones. Blind-zone object identification can prevent a lot of accidents and financial damage. CAMERA, RADAR, and LiDAR sensors can all be used to find objects in blind spots. The CAMERA sensor may be a preferable option in this situation due to some of its features. The acquired image has some aberrations since wider lenses have a larger field of vision. The removal of distortion from the image is absolutely necessary for both object detection and classification. I will present a CAMERA sensor, particularly a wide-angle camera to detect the object in blind-zones and mathematical formulas that can be used in image processing to remove distortion from the image.
